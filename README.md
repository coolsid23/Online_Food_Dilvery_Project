 # Introduction
 
The Online Food Delivery Business Intelligence & Performance Analysis Using SQL project focuses on analyzing structured transactional data from an online food delivery platform. The dataset consists of five interconnected tables — customers, restaurants, orders, order items, and delivery agents — designed to simulate a real-world marketplace environment. This project aims to transform raw operational data into meaningful insights by examining customer behavior, restaurant performance, sales trends, and delivery efficiency within a relational database system.
In a competitive digital marketplace, data plays a critical role in improving profitability, service quality, and strategic decision-making. By analysing order patterns, discount usage, payment methods, customer demographics, restaurant ratings, and delivery times, businesses can identify performance gaps and growth opportunities. Understanding these metrics allows organizations to optimize pricing strategies, enhance customer retention, improve delivery operations, and strengthen partnerships with high-performing restaurants.
SQL was used as the primary analytical tool to extract, join, and aggregate data across multiple tables. Through structured queries involving joins, grouping, filtering, subqueries, and calculated metrics, key performance indicators such as total revenue, average order value, customer growth trends, and operational efficiency were derived. This project reflects real-world business intelligence practices used in food delivery and e-commerce platforms, demonstrating practical SQL expertise and the ability to apply data analytics techniques to solve business problems effectively.

## Background

This project was developed as an individual SQL assignment for the Datapencil organization.
